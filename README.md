SMACSS-BEM-Kit

================

The boilerplate for quickly starting off your projects. The CSS is handled with a SMACSS structure and BEM naming for maintainability.

## Setup

    npm install
    bower install

If you want to build and start serve:

    gulp serve:build

Or just build your project:

    gulp
